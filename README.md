# Clusterless decoding of mouse position from hippocampal and olfactory bulb extracellular recordings
### Smear Lab

We have written code from scratch to work with a simple 1D case of simulated data following Eden et al., 2015. For implementing the algorithm in a 2D case with multiple channels of recordings we used the package https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification
