We have written code from scratch to work with a simple 1D case of simulated data following [Eden et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4805376/). For implementing the algorithm in a 2D case with multiple channels of recordings, we used the package [replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification).
